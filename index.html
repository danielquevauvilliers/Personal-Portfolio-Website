            <div class="bio">
              <p>I was born in the 70s on the island of Mauritius and grew up loving computers and computer games. My first computer was an ACORN Electron, amongst the first home personal computers and that introduced me to computing with BASIC using the family TV as monitor and cassette tapes to load programs.</p>
              <p>However, after school, I started a career as airline pilot and have been flying for the past 32 years, with more than 18,000 flying hours. Nevertheless, I have always kept in touch with programming and been involved in various projects related to computing. As a young adult, I enjoyed building PCs from scratch and used them for gaming. In my airline career, I was involved from the start in the 'Going Digital' campaign by Airbus during which our airline migrated all aircraft related manuals from paper to digital copies. As a Technical Pilot, I was also involved in the introduction of the Electronic Flight Bags into our airline and also during the entry into service of our Airbus A350 aircrafts.</p>
              <p>I have always been passionate about computers and programming and decided last year to go back to studying using the fantastic resources available on the web nowadays. I am proud to present this portfolio with some of my achievements (including the portfolio itself ðŸ˜Š)!</p>
